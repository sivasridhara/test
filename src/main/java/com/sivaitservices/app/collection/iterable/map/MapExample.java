public class MapExample {
    /*
    An object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value.
    
    1) This interface takes the place of the Dictionary class, which was a totally abstract class rather than an interface.
    
    2)The Map interface provides three collection views, which allow a map's contents to be viewed as a set of keys, collection of values, or set of key-value mappings.

    3)The order of a map is defined as the order in which the iterators on the map's collection views return their elements.Some map implementations, like the TreeMap class, make specific guarantees as to their order; others, like the HashMap class, do not.
    
    4)Some map implementations have restrictions on the keys and values they may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null keys and values, and some have restrictions on the types of their keys. Attempting to insert an ineligible key or value throws an unchecked exception, typically NullPointerException or ClassCastException.
